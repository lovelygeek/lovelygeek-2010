"Cristina, Thank you so much for the creation of my web site. I appreciated your attention to detail that made our web site standout among our competition. I have received numerous compliments about the web site from my customers as they have noted how user friendly, informative and enjoyable our web site is to explore. It has definitely increased our business. I had hired a web designer prior to our business relationship and felt very frustrated because she could not seem to catch my vision for what I wanted. You listened very carefully to my business needs and translated them in to an amazing web site for a small business owner. I feel I can compete with the pros!‚Äù

<p>Portfoli-o at CAssenza.com was my very first portfolio site. Started in 2007 I wanted a clean simple design that would allow me to showcase all my past web designs. I let CAssenza.com expire in 2009 (right before I was engaged) so it wouldn't compromise myself should I end up changing my last name, and I was also trying to make more of a brand for myself.</p>

<p>JoshuaJeeper.com was the personal web site of my husband Joshua. It was supposed to be a site all about cars, where he'd blog about life as a Mercedes tech and keeping track of his current vehicle projects. The design featured his car, a 1985 300TDT Mercedes-Benz, his pride-and-joy. Joshua wasn't much of a blogger so eventually the site retired a year later.</p>

<p>Darth-Cena.net was my 2nd personal web site. It was purchased on October 25th 2005 through Dreamhost web services. I decided on Darth Cena because the Darth part is from Star Wars (one of my biggest fandoms) and Cena is my nickname. Darth-Cena.net was closed on January 22nd, 2011 as I decided to retire from publicly blogging about my personal life.</p>

<p>In early November 2003, I decided to move from creating web sites on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocities">Geocities</a> since I was tired of the errors and annoying pop-ups. I got myself a subdomain on <a href="http://www.sphosting.com">Sphosting</a>. There, I chose my subdomain name as cenamaria (a combination of my nickname Cena and middle name Maria) and began working to create my first theme, "Hogwarts is my Home." On February 14th, 2004 I bought Cenamaria.com. I kept my hosting at Sphosting for awhile, but soon I wanted to do more with my site; I realized I would have to switch hostings in order to get more freedom with my site. After much looking around, I switched hostings to <a href="http://dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> on October 21st and have remained there ever since.</p>

<p>After awhile, I decided I wanted something new and fresh since a lot of people in real life knew where my site was, I wanted to be more anonymous on the web. I closed Cenamaria.com and opened up Darth-Cena.net.</p>

<?php if (is_page('livejournal')) { ?>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Way back in July of 2002, I just returned from spending two weeks up at <a href="http://www.sugarloafcamp.org">Sugarloaf Fine Arts Camp</a>. One of my friends gave me a link to her web site on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocities">Geocities</a>. I checked it out and saw that her web page was just a small site all about her along with some photos, links, and an online journal on <a href="http://livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a>. I thought it was so neat that anyone could just make a web site, so I signed up for the free package on Geocities to create my own web page.</p>

<p>At the time, you needed a code from a current user in order to get a LiveJournal account, so I got a code from my friend to create my own journal as well. This was when I first began to discover the wonderful world of web page creating and online journaling. I started by creating designs for my own journal as well as for friends. I began creating these designs in 2003 and stopped sometime in 2006.</p>
