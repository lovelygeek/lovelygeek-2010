# LovelyGeek 2010
The very first theme for my portfolio site back in 2010.

This site was built on my lovely 15" <a href="http://apple.com">MacBook Pro</a> using <a href="http://adobe.com">Adobe</a> Photoshop CS5, Smultron, MAMP, and Firefox. It is powered by <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> and is hosted at <a href="http://dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a>.
